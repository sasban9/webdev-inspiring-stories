Here are some other strategies similar to the "picks and shovels" approach that can lead to profitability by positioning a business around essential services, enabling infrastructure, or complementary goods:

### 1. **"Sell the Byproducts"**
   - Capitalize on byproducts or waste from your main process. Many companies have found a secondary revenue stream by selling what was once considered waste (e.g., breweries selling spent grain to farms as animal feed).

### 2. **"Offer the Razor, Sell the Blades"**
   - Give or sell the main product (razor) at a low price, but charge for consumables or replacements (blades). Examples include printers (where ink is sold at a premium) and gaming consoles (where games or subscriptions generate revenue).

### 3. **"Be the Tollbooth"**
   - Position yourself as an intermediary, charging fees for access to a market or essential resource. This could mean creating a marketplace and taking a cut of each transaction, as with e-commerce platforms or payment processors.

### 4. **"The Aspirin Strategy"**
   - Solve a pain point that people are eager to alleviate. Products and services that solve immediate, pressing needs (like pain relievers or time-saving software) often command higher demand and loyalty.

### 5. **"Sell the Dream, then the Reality"**
   - Start with aspirational marketing to attract attention and sales, then provide services or products to help customers reach that ideal. Fitness products often employ this by marketing a fit lifestyle first and then selling gear, supplements, or training plans.

### 6. **"Create Ecosystems"**
   - Develop an ecosystem where customers are incentivized to stay within your brand or platform, like Apple's closed ecosystem of devices and services. This encourages brand loyalty and increases the lifetime value of each customer.

### 7. **"Freemium Model"**
   - Offer a basic product for free, then provide premium features or expanded services for a price. This model works well in software and digital services, where customers can try before they buy.

### 8. **"Provide Tools for the Experts"**
   - Offer specialized tools, software, or resources that cater to professionals in specific industries. Experts are often willing to pay a premium for high-quality, reliable tools that make their work easier or more efficient.

### 9. **"Be the Support System"**
   - Focus on services or support that others in your industry or sector rely on. For example, companies that provide logistics, maintenance, or customer service infrastructure to other businesses (like Amazon's logistics for small sellers) have steady demand.

### 10. **"Make Money on Maintenance and Upgrades"**
   - Provide affordable entry-level products but monetize on maintenance, repairs, or upgrades over time. This is common in the automotive and electronics industries, where routine services or upgrades create additional revenue streams.

### 11. **"Capture Network Effects"**
   - Build a product or platform that becomes more valuable as more people use it. Social networks, marketplaces, and collaborative tools leverage network effects, creating a “winner-takes-all” scenario where dominant players benefit from high user retention.

### 12. **"Upsell the Essentials"**
   - Once a customer has purchased a foundational product, offer complementary or higher-end versions as an upsell. For example, after selling a camera, a company might upsell lenses, filters, or editing software.

### 13. **"Provide Certification or Licensing"**
   - Establish expertise and offer certification or licensing for other businesses or professionals. This is common in software, where companies offer training and certification to develop a certified network of professionals who work with their products.

### 14. **"Monetize Data"**
   - Collect, analyze, and sell anonymized data insights (while respecting privacy regulations). Companies that amass valuable data on consumer behavior, like Google and Facebook, often leverage that data for targeted advertising.

### 15. **"Sell Peace of Mind"**
   - Offer warranties, insurance, or extended support plans that ensure customers feel secure in their purchase. This works well for big-ticket items like electronics, vehicles, and appliances.

### 16. **"Build for Scalability"**
   - Design your business to scale easily, especially through digital products or services where the cost of scaling is minimal. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses benefit from scalability, where additional customers increase revenue without proportionate increases in costs.

### 17. **"Position as a Curator"**
   - Act as a trusted curator of products or services, adding value by selecting only the best options. This is common in subscription boxes or marketplaces with a high-quality standard, where customers pay for the convenience of expertly chosen items.

### 18. **"Sell the Experience, Not Just the Product"**
   - Create an experience around your product to enhance its perceived value. For instance, premium brands often focus on the shopping experience (luxurious stores, personalized service) as much as the product itself.

### 19. **"Do It for Them"**
   - Offer done-for-you services in industries where customers might need guidance or expertise. This could mean providing full-service options, as seen in web design, consulting, or financial planning.

These strategies let you tap into indirect value chains, recurring revenue models, or customer loyalty enhancements, all of which can contribute significantly to long-term profitability.
