jQuery was invented by John Resig in 2006 to address the complexity of JavaScript development, especially around handling cross-browser inconsistencies and simplifying common tasks in web development. At that time, JavaScript was powerful but notoriously inconsistent across different browsers, making it challenging to write code that would work reliably for all users.

jQuery aimed to streamline and simplify JavaScript development by providing a single, lightweight library that handled these differences seamlessly. Some key motivations behind jQuery’s creation include:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: jQuery abstracts away the inconsistencies across major browsers, allowing developers to write code that works universally without needing to add browser-specific tweaks.
  
2. **Simplifying DOM Manipulation**: Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) was verbose and complex in vanilla JavaScript. jQuery made it easier by introducing a simple, chainable syntax for selecting and manipulating HTML elements.
  
3. **Streamlining AJAX Calls**: AJAX was becoming more common as web applications grew more interactive. jQuery simplified making AJAX requests, making it easier to build responsive applications.
  
4. **Event Handling**: JavaScript’s event handling was cumbersome and inconsistent. jQuery offered a unified approach that allowed developers to add event listeners quickly and reliably.
  
5. **Easy Animation and Effects**: jQuery provided built-in animations and effects, allowing developers to add interactive and visually appealing elements to websites without needing extensive knowledge of JavaScript.

jQuery became a foundational tool for web development due to these advantages. It dramatically improved productivity and reduced the complexity of JavaScript, making it a popular choice for developers and significantly shaping the way JavaScript was written for many years.
