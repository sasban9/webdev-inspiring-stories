Web builders are tools that simplify the process of creating and managing websites, catering to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced developers. Here are several reasons why web builders are needed and how they address various challenges in web development:

### 1. **User-Friendly Interface**

### 2. **Time Efficiency**
- **Rapid Development:** Web builders enable users to create websites quickly. Templates and pre-designed elements streamline the development process, allowing users to launch their sites in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional coding methods.

### 4. **Customization and Flexibility**
