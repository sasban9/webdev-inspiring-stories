Ethereum split into two separate blockchains—**Ethereum (ETH)** and **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**—primarily due to a disagreement within the community regarding how to handle a significant hack that occurred in 2016. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the events leading to the split:

### 1. **The DAO and the Hack**
- In April 2016, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as **The DAO** was launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It aimed to create a venture capital fund for the crypto space and raised over $150 million in Ether (ETH) from thousands of investors.
- In June 2016, a vulnerability in The DAO's code was exploited, resulting in approximately $60 million worth of Ether being drained from the organization. The hack raised concerns about the security and future of Ethereum.

### 2. **Community Response**
- After the hack, the Ethereum community was faced with a critical decision: how to respond to the theft. There were two main factions within the community:
  - **Proponents of a Hard Fork:** Many members argued for a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain to reverse the hack's effects, restore the stolen funds to investors, and preserve confidence in the platform. This option was seen as a way to maintain the integrity of The DAO and support its investors.
  - **Opponents of a Hard Fork:** Others believed that reversing the hack would undermine the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, such as immutability and trustlessness. They argued that the blockchain should remain unchanged to preserve the historical record of transactions, including the hack.

### 3. **The Hard Fork Decision**
- On July 20, 2016, after extensive discussions and community voting, the Ethereum network underwent a hard fork. This resulted in the creation of a new blockchain that effectively returned the stolen funds to The DAO investors. This new chain became known as **Ethereum (ETH)**.
- The original blockchain, which continued on its previous course without the changes introduced by the hard fork, became known as **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**. It retained the original code and history, including the hack, as a testament to the principle of immutability.

### 4. **Aftermath and Impact**
- The hard fork and the resulting split generated significant debate within the cryptocurrency community about ethics, governance, and the nature of decentralized systems. 
- Ethereum (ETH) has since grown to become one of the largest and most widely used blockchain platforms, supporting a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
- Ethereum Classic (ETC), while smaller in market capitalization and ecosystem development, continues to operate and uphold the original vision of Ethereum.

### Conclusion
The split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic highlights the complexities and philosophical debates surrounding blockchain technology. It raised important questions about governance, consensus, and the balance between user protection and the principles of decentralization. Both chains have since developed independently, with their own communities, use cases, and futures in the evolving blockchain landscape.
