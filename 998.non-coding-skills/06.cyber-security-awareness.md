Software developers must be aware of fundamental cybersecurity practices to protect applications, data, and users. Key areas include:

---

### **1. Secure Coding Practices**
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant minimal permissions required for tasks to limit attack surfaces.
- **Secure Storage:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive data; use encrypted storage for secrets.

---

### **2. Authentication and Authorization**
- Implement strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Use frameworks like OAuth or OpenID for secure authorization mechanisms.

---

### **3. Data Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES encryption).
- Avoid exposing sensitive data through API endpoints or logs.

---

### **4. Threat Awareness**
- Familiarize with common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and their mitigations.
- Be aware of phishing, malware, and insider threats.

---

### **5. Dependency Management**
- Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like Dependabot or Snyk for automated dependency monitoring.

---

### **6. Secure Infrastructure**
- Use secure configurations for servers, databases, and networks.
- Monitor for unauthorized access using intrusion detection systems (IDS).

---

### **7. Compliance and Legal Awareness**
- Understand regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS to ensure secure handling of user data.
