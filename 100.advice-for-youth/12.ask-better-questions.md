## **How to Ask Better Questions**  

🔹 **1. Be Curious About Everything**  
- Develop the habit of **wanting to know more.**  
- Instead of saying, **“I already know this,”** ask, **“What else can I learn about this?”**  

🔹 **2. Use Open-Ended Questions (Not Just Yes/No Questions)**

🔹 **3. Follow Up with Deeper Questions**  
- Don’t just ask one question—**dig deeper.**  
- **Example:**  
  - "Why did you choose this career?" → "What’s been the biggest challenge?" → "How did you overcome that?"

- Most people **do the opposite.**  

🔹 **6. Ask, ‘What If’ and ‘How’ Questions**
