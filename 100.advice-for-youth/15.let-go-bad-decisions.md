### **15. Don’t Let One Bad Decision Define You**  

Everyone makes mistakes—**bad financial choices, failed relationships, career missteps, or missed opportunities.** But too many people let **one bad decision** shape their self-worth and **hold them back for years.**  

The truth? **One mistake does not define your future.** What matters is how you **learn, adapt, and move forward.**

  - “What’s the next best move I can make?”  

🔄 **4. Most People Forget Your Mistakes Faster Than You Do**

  - **People are busy with their own lives.**  
  - They forget things **faster than you think.**  
  - What feels like a **huge mistake to you is a passing moment for others.**  

🌱 **5. Growth Comes From Overcoming Challenges**
